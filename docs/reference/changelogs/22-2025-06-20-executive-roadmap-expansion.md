**Status:** Complete âœ…

### Files Updated:
- **UPDATED:** `docs/explanation/concepts/neuralake-implementation-roadmap.md` - Major expansion adding executive analysis section (2,800+ lines of strategic content)

### Description:
Significantly expanded the Neuralake implementation roadmap to provide comprehensive strategic analysis from multiple executive perspectives. The document now serves as both an engineering guide and executive briefing, covering technical decisions, business case analysis, financial projections, risk assessment, competitive positioning, and strategic recommendations suitable for presentation to stakeholders from engineers to the board of directors.

### Reasoning:
The original roadmap focused primarily on technical implementation details for new engineers. However, stakeholders at different levels (CTO, Software Architect, CEO, Board) require different perspectives on the same technical decisions. This expansion transforms the document into a comprehensive strategic resource that addresses technical architecture, business justification, financial impact, and competitive positioningâ€”providing the complete context needed for executive decision-making and team alignment.
