### Description:
This update encompasses a significant refactoring of the Neuralake project structure and codebase. The project now follows a standard layout with dedicated directories for documentation (`docs`), source code (`src`), and utility scripts (`scripts`). Core Python modules (`config.py`, `my_tables.py`, `my_catalog.py`, `query_data.py`) were refactored to be environment-aware, driven by `NEURALAKE_ENV`, eliminating redundant `*_production.py` files.

The final stage of this refactor involved correcting the `my_tables.py` instantiation of `neuralake.core.ParquetTable` by removing an unsupported `storage_options` argument from its constructor. S3 options handling was aligned with the library's API (where options are typically passed to `__call__`, though configuration is now verified via `get_s3_storage_options()`). The `production_verification.py` script was rewritten to comprehensively test the new structure, including environment switching, S3 configuration assertions, and addressing `unittest` deprecations. All verification tests now pass.

### Reasoning:
The primary driver was to mature the project from an experimental phase to a more maintainable and scalable structure, adhering to standard software development practices. This involved:
1.  **Standardizing Directory Structure:** For clarity and easier navigation.
2.  **Centralizing Configuration:** Using `config.py` to manage environment-specific behavior, promoting DRY principles.
3.  **API Adherence:** Ensuring the usage of `neuralake.core.ParquetTable` aligns with its actual API.
4.  **Robust Verification:** Creating a comprehensive test suite (`production_verification.py`) to validate the refactored system.

The previous structure with separate `_production.py` files was prone to duplication. The refactoring consolidates logic and improves overall code quality.

### Key Decisions & Trade-offs:
- **Project Restructure:** Adopted a standard Python project layout (`src`, `docs`, `scripts`).
- **Configuration Management:** Consolidated environment-specific logic into `config.py`.
- **Test Assertion Change (S3):** Tests for table S3 configuration now verify the *environment's S3 configuration* via `get_s3_storage_options()`.

### Considerations / Issues Encountered:
- **Multi-stage Refactor:** This changelog entry summarizes the outcome of a comprehensive refactoring process.
- **External Library API:** Relied on reverse-engineered local API docs for `neuralake==0.0.5`.
- **Dynamic Test Environment:** The `env_context` in `production_verification.py` reloads modules, requiring careful import management.

### Future Work:
- **Enhanced S3 Call Testing:** Add tests for actual S3 data operations via `neuralake.ParquetTable.__call__()`.
- **Credential Handling Review:** Review S3 credential handling by the `neuralake` library.
- **README Updates:** Update the main `README.md` to reflect the new project structure and setup instructions.

### Considerations / Issues Encountered:
- **External Library Documentation:** The lack of live/official documentation for `neuralake==0.0.5` necessitated relying on reverse-engineered local `ParquetTable.md`, which correctly indicated the `__init__` signature.
- **Dynamic Test Environment:** The `env_context` in `production_verification.py` unloads and reloads modules, requiring careful management of imports within the test methods themselves.
- **S3 Interaction in `__call__`:** Actual S3 connectivity during data operations (e.g., when `table_instance()` is invoked to fetch data) will depend on the `neuralake` library correctly using the `endpoint_url` (and other S3 options) passed to its `__call__` method. The current tests primarily focus on configuration and instantiation, with `test_06_query_script_execution` mocking the `__call__` method.
### Future Work:
- **Enhanced S3 Call Testing:** Consider adding tests that perform actual S3 data reads/writes (mocked or live against local MinIO) through the `neuralake.ParquetTable` `__call__` method. This would validate that `endpoint_url` and other S3 options are correctly passed and utilized by the external library during data access.
- **Credential Handling Review:** Review how S3 credentials (key, secret) are handled by the `neuralake` library when `endpoint_url` is provided to its `__call__` method, ensuring it aligns with `config.py`'s credential management strategy, especially for production scenarios.
