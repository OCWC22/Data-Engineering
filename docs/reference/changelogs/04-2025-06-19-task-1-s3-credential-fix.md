# Changelog: 2025-06-19 - Fix S3 Credential Handling for Local Development (Task 1 Enhancement)

**Task:** [[1]] Enhance S3 Integration with Environment-Specific Credentials
**Status:** Done

### Files Updated:
- **UPDATED:** `neuralake/src/my_tables.py` - Injected S3 storage options into environment variables to ensure credential availability for downstream libraries.

### Description:
This update addresses a subtle but critical issue in the local development environment. It enhances the S3 integration by automatically setting the S3 storage options (including default MinIO credentials) as environment variables when the application runs locally. This ensures that underlying data libraries like Polars and PyArrow can reliably access the local MinIO S3 service without manual environment setup.

### Reasoning:
While the `storage_options` dictionary was correctly configured, it was discovered that not all parts of the data access libraries consistently use these options for authentication. Many tools in the PyData ecosystem default to checking for standard AWS environment variables (e.g., `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`). By programmatically setting these variables at runtime in the local environment, we create a more robust and foolproof connection to our local MinIO instance, improving developer experience and reducing configuration-related errors.

### Key Decisions & Trade-offs:
- **Decision:** Programmatically set environment variables (`os.environ`) from the configuration system within the `create_part_table` function. This ensures credentials are set just-in-time for S3-dependent operations.
- **Trade-off:** This approach modifies the runtime environment, which is generally a practice to be used with care. However, the change is scoped only to the local environment and solves a significant integration problem with a standard, widely-supported mechanism for AWS SDKs and compatible tools. The benefit of a seamless local setup outweighs the minor complexity.

### Considerations / Issues Encountered:
- **Root Cause:** The core issue was that Polars/PyArrow's S3 filesystem integration did not appear to be using the `storage_options` dictionary for credentials in all contexts.
- **Solution:** Setting the credentials as environment variables provided a more direct and reliable method for authentication that is universally recognized by these tools.

### Future Work:
- Add logging to confirm which environment variables are being set during startup in the local environment.
- Consider creating a small, dedicated health check script to verify S3 connectivity using the configured credentials before running main application logic.
- Update the `ONBOARDING.md` or other developer guides to note that S3 credentials are now handled automatically in the local environment.
