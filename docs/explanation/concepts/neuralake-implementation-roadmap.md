# Neuralake Implementation Roadmap: A Guide for New Engineers

> **For New Engineers**: This document explains what we've built so far in our Data Engineering project and what exciting work remains ahead. If you're confused about the tasks.json file or want to understand our end-to-end vision, this is your starting point.

## Executive Summary: What We're Building

The **Neuralake** project is implementing a Neuralink-inspired dual-engine data platform with a "Code as Catalog" philosophy. Think of it as building two complementary engines:

- **🎯 "Surgical Strike" (Rust/Polars)**: Low-latency, real-time data processing for millisecond responses
- **💪 "Workhorse" (Spark)**: High-throughput batch processing for massive analytical workloads

Our core principle: **Everything must work on a developer's laptop first, then scale to production.**

## What We've Built: The Solid Foundation ✅

### Task 1: S3 Integration (DONE)
**What it does**: Local development environment that mimics AWS S3 using MinIO in Docker.

**Why it matters**: Enables cost-free development with full S3 compatibility. No cloud costs during development!

**Key files**:
- `docker-compose.yml` - MinIO service definition
- `setup_minio.sh` - Automated bucket creation
- `scripts/upload_sample_data_to_minio.py` - Data upload utilities

### Task 2: Code Quality Tooling (DONE)
**What it does**: Integrated `ruff` linter and formatter for consistent, high-quality Python code.

**Why it matters**: Prevents bugs, enforces coding standards, and enables confident refactoring.

**Key files**:
- `pyproject.toml` - Ruff configuration with 200+ linting rules
- `scripts/lint.py` - Development scripts for code quality checks

### Task 3: CI/CD Pipeline (DONE)
**What it does**: GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing, linting, and quality checks.

**Why it matters**: Catches bugs before they reach production, enables confident collaboration.

**Key files**:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Complete CI pipeline
- `scripts/production_verification.py` - Automated production readiness tests

### Task 4: Core Delta Lake (DONE)
**What it does**: ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time travel on object storage.

**Why it matters**: This is the foundation of our data lakehouse - reliable, versioned data storage.

**Key features**:
- ✅ ACID transactions (no more corrupted data)
- ✅ Schema evolution (add columns without breaking existing data)
- ✅ Time travel (query data as it existed at any point in time)
- ✅ Concurrent read/write operations

**Key files**:
- `src/delta_tables.py` - Core Delta Lake implementation
- `src/delta_config.py` - Configuration and connection management
- `tests/test_delta_lake.py` - Comprehensive test suite

### Task 5: Code as Catalog Core (DONE)
**What it does**: Define data tables in Python code, auto-generate documentation and APIs.

**Why it matters**: No more stale documentation! The catalog is always accurate because it's generated from the code that defines the data.

**Key features**:
- ✅ Decorator-based table definitions
- ✅ Static HTML site generation for browsing tables
- ✅ Auto-generated Python client code snippets
- ✅ Support for both Parquet and Delta tables

**Key files**:
- `src/catalog_core.py` - Core catalog classes and decorators
- `src/ssg.py` - Static site generator
- `scripts/generate_catalog_site.py` - Site generation utilities
- `demo-catalog-site/` - Example generated catalog site

## Current Work: Building the Real-Time Engine 🚧

### Task 6: Low-Latency Rust Writer (IN PROGRESS)
**What it's solving**: The "small files problem" in streaming data.

**The challenge**: Streaming data arrives in small batches. Writing each batch as a separate file kills read performance (thousands of slow network requests).

**Our solution**: Three-process architecture inspired by Neuralink:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Kafka Stream] --> B[Writer Process<br/>Fast ingestion]
    B --> C[Small Parquet Files]
    
    C --> D[Compaction Process<br/>Merge small files]
    D --> E[Large Optimized Files]
    
    E --> F[Vacuum Process<br/>Clean up old files]
    F --> G[Storage Optimized]
    
    H[DynamoDB Locks<br/>Coordinate processes] -.-> B
    H -.-> D
    H -.-> F
```

**Key files in development**:
- `rust-writer/src/writer.rs` - High-speed data ingestion
- `rust-writer/src/compaction.rs` - File optimization
- `rust-writer/src/vacuum.rs` - Storage cleanup

## Understanding Streaming Data Fusion

### Hot Path vs Cold Path

Our architecture implements two complementary data paths:

#### 🔥 Hot Path (Real-Time)
- **Purpose**: Millisecond responses for real-time applications
- **Technology**: Rust + Polars + DataFusion
- **Use cases**: 
  - Live neural signal processing
  - Real-time dashboards
  - Interactive queries
  - Alert systems

#### ❄️ Cold Path (Analytics)
- **Purpose**: High-throughput batch processing
- **Technology**: Spark + Delta Lake

  - Historical analysis
  - Model training on petabytes of data
  - Complex ETL transformations
  - Research workloads

### Query Ingestion Patterns

Once complete, our system will support multiple query patterns:

1. **Real-time SQL via ROAPI**: `SELECT * FROM neural_signals WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL 1 MINUTE`
2. **Interactive Python via Polars**: Fast exploratory data analysis on a laptop
3. **Large-scale Spark SQL**: Complex analytical queries across years of data
4. **Catalog-driven Discovery**: Browse available datasets through auto-generated documentation
