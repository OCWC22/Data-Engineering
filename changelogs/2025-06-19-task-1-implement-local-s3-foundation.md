# Changelog: 2025-06-19 - Implement Local S3 Foundation (Task 1)

**Task:** [[1]] Configure AWS S3 Integration
**Status:** Done

### Files Updated:
- **CREATED:** `neuralake/create_sample_data.py` - Script to generate sample Parquet data locally.
- **CREATED:** `neuralake/my_tables.py` - Initial definitions for the `neuralake` data catalog.
- **CREATED:** `neuralake/my_catalog.py` - Established the main `neuralake` catalog object.
- **CREATED:** `neuralake/query_data.py` - Initial script to query data from the local filesystem.
- **CREATED:** `neuralake/ONBOARDING.md` - High-level architectural and educational documentation.
- **CREATED:** `neuralake/docker-compose.yml` - Defines the local MinIO service for S3 emulation.
- **CREATED:** `neuralake/setup_minio.sh` - Script to automate starting MinIO and creating the `neuralake-bucket`.
- **CREATED:** `neuralake/upload_sample_data_to_minio.py` - Script to load data into the local S3.
- **CREATED:** `neuralake/pyproject.toml` - Project configuration for Poetry-based dependency management.
- **CREATED:** `neuralake/poetry.lock` - Lockfile for deterministic, reproducible builds.
- **CREATED:** `.gitignore` - Standard Python gitignore file.
- **UPDATED:** `neuralake/my_tables.py` - Refactored `ParquetTable` definition to match the correct API for S3 querying.
- **UPDATED:** `neuralake/query_data.py` - Reworked to query from the MinIO S3 endpoint instead of the local filesystem.
- **UPDATED:** `neuralake/README.md` - Added instructions for setting up and running the local S3 environment.
- **DELETED:** `requirements.txt` - Made obsolete by the migration to Poetry.

### Description:
This update marks the successful completion of Task 1 from `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` It establishes a fully functional, end-to-end data pipeline running on the local machine. The project structure was defined, dependencies were migrated to a robust Poetry-based system, a local MinIO S3 server was containerized, and data was successfully generated, uploaded, and queried. This validates the core components of our local development environment and our "scale-down" philosophy.

### Reasoning:
To accelerate development and eliminate cloud costs during the initial build-out phase, we are emulating the AWS S3 environment locally using MinIO. This provides a high-fidelity, S3-compatible API that allows us to develop and test all Delta Lake and cloud storage features with confidence that they will be portable to a production AWS environment. Migrating to Poetry was a critical prerequisite to ensure a stable and reproducible environment for this complex integration work.

### Key Decisions & Trade-offs:
- **Project Structure:** A multi-project monorepo structure was chosen to ensure dependency isolation and long-term scalability. The trade-off is slightly more complex navigation (`cd neuralake/`) for vastly improved project robustness.
- **Dependency Management:** Standardized on Poetry over `pip/requirements.txt` to gain deterministic, reproducible builds via `poetry.lock`. This was crucial for resolving subsequent library conflicts.
- **Implementation Detail:** Chose to use the lower-level `pyarrow.fs.S3FileSystem` for data uploads. This provided more explicit control, which proved critical for debugging initial connection issues. The trade-off was slightly more verbose code for significantly higher robustness.

### Considerations / Issues Encountered:
This was a multi-stage debugging process that peeled back layers of the library stack:

1.  **`neuralake` API Discrepancy:** The primary blocker was a `TypeError` caused by the `neuralake==0.0.5` library's `ParquetTable` constructor not matching its public documentation.
2.  **Resolution:** Systematically debugged using the Python REPL and `help()` function to discover the true API contract (`partitioning` is a required argument). The fix was applied to `my_tables.py`, and this process is now documented in a dedicated case study.

### Future Work:
- Proceed to `Task 2: Develop Scalable Data Generation Utility` from `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json`, which will populate our new S3 foundation.
- Formalize the `neuralake` API debugging session into a `docs/case-studies/` document for onboarding.
- Add linters and formatters (like `ruff`) to the `dev` dependencies in `pyproject.toml` to enforce code quality.
