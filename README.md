- **Tasks 7-17**: Ready to start once Task 6 real implementation is complete

## The Core Philosophy

The core philosophy is building **Simple Systems for Complex Data**, centered on two key ideas:
1.  **Code-as-Catalog:** The entire data landscape is defined, versioned, and queried as code. No GUIs, no separate services, no stale documentation. The code is the single source of truth.
2.  **Lightweight, Performant Tooling:** The stack is built on a foundation of Rust-based libraries (`polars`, `datafusion`) for maximum performance and a modern Python toolchain (`poetry`, `uv`) for a superior developer experience.

## Project Structure & Documentation

This repository follows a structured layout to separate concerns and make the project, especially its documentation, easy to navigate for both humans and AI agents.

    -   `scripts/`: Utility and verification scripts (`production_verification.py`, `create_sample_data.py`).
    -   `pyproject.toml` & `poetry.lock`: Poetry configuration for managing dependencies.
-   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the entire playground.

## What Makes This Project Special: Neuralink's Architecture

We're implementing the **exact** data engineering patterns described by Neuralink's engineering team:

### üèóÔ∏è **Dual-Engine Architecture:**
- **"Surgical Strike" (Rust Stack):** Polars + DataFusion + ROAPI for low-latency, high-performance operations
- **"Workhorse" (Spark Stack):** Apache Spark for large-scale, distributed ELT operations
- Both engines operate on the same Delta Lake storage

### üîß **Technology Stack:**
- **Rust** for performance-critical components (writer, query engine, API layer)
- **Polars** as the standard DataFrame library for all non-Spark operations  
- **Delta Lake** for all transactional storage with ACID guarantees
- **Apache DataFusion** for embeddable query processing
- **ROAPI** for auto-generated, high-performance SQL APIs

### üöÄ **Key Components We're Building:**
1. **Low-Latency "Surgical Strike" Writer** (Rust-based, 3-process architecture)
2. **Code-as-Catalog System** (Define tables in code, generate APIs automatically)
3. **Auto-Generated SQL APIs** (ROAPI + DataFusion, no custom API code)
4. **Real-time Streaming Pipeline** (Kafka ‚Üí Writer ‚Üí Delta ‚Üí ROAPI)
5. **Performance Benchmarking** (Comparing "surgical strike" vs "workhorse" engines)

**üìñ For the complete technical deep-dive, see [docs/explanation/neuralake.md](./docs/explanation/neuralake.md)**

## An AI-Native Development Philosophy

This project is more than just code; it's a living blueprint for a new way of building software. It's an **AI-native workflow** designed from the ground up to be understood, maintained, and enhanced by both human developers and AI coding agents.

Our methodology is built on four pillars: **Communication, Documentation, Organization, and Architecture.** The goal is to eliminate ambiguity and provide deep context, treating our AI counterparts like brilliant but inexperienced interns who thrive on clarity.

### The Heart of the Project: The `docs/` Folder

The `docs/` directory is the soul of this repository. It's where the "why" behind every decision lives. Before a single line of code is written for a new feature, its purpose, design, trade-offs, and implementation strategy are documented here. This ensures that any developer‚Äîhuman or AI‚Äîcan onboard quickly and contribute meaningfully without getting lost.

### The Core Workflow: A Cycle of Deliberate Action

We follow a structured, iterative process designed to ensure that every change is well-planned, researched, and documented.

1.  **Plan with Taskmaster:** Every new feature begins in **[Taskmaster](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master)**. We create a Product Requirements Document (`.taskmaster/docs/prd.txt`) and use Taskmaster to generate a detailed, structured plan. This is our single source of truth for what needs to be built.

2.  **Deep Research & Refinement:** With a plan in hand, we turn to external, specialized AI tools for deep research. We use reasoning models (like Claude 4 Sonnet Thinking or Gemini 2.5 Pro with Extended Thinking in Google AI Studio, o3) paired with research tools that have full web and social access (like Perplexity) to validate our approach against the latest best practices, library documentation, and security advisories. The findings from this research are used to refine the plan. 

3.  **Implement:** With a research-backed plan, we begin coding.

4.  **Test:** We rigorously verify that the implementation works as expected.

5.  **Document with Changelogs:** Upon completion, we create a new, permanent record in the `docs/reference/changelogs/` directory. This is not just a list of changes; it's a narrative that explains the "why," the trade-offs, and the reasoning behind the implementation, providing invaluable context for future work.

### Changelog as Catalog: The Project's Memory

Our changelog is our institutional memory. Each entry is a standalone file, making it version-controlled, auditable, and easily discoverable.

-   **Naming Convention:** We follow a strict format: `XX-YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`, where `XX` is a zero-padded sequential number. This provides chronological order and versioning at a glance.
-   **Content Structure:** Each changelog provides deep context, including the Taskmaster task ID, a summary of changes, the reasoning behind key decisions, and any trade-offs made. This is critical for preventing confusion and enabling effective collaboration with AI agents.
-   **Example in Practice:** The `neuralake` library has no public API documentation. We had to reverse-engineer it. Our findings and the script used to generate the docs are recorded in changelog `05-2025-06-19-api-docs-generation.md`, preserving that knowledge forever.

### Recommended Toolchain: The MCP-Powered IDE

To fully embrace this AI-native workflow, we strongly recommend an IDE integrated with **MCP (Model Control Protocol)** servers. This turns your editor into a powerful, context-aware development environment.

Our recommended stack of MCPs includes:

1.  **[Task Master](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master):** (ESSENTIAL) The core of our project management system - see tasks, update status, get next steps
2.  **[Context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7):** (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Provides always-up-to-date documentation for any library, directly in your IDE. It's more reliable than any web search.
3.  **Sequential Thinking:** Turns any base model into a powerful reasoning engine, perfect for planning and problem-solving.
4.  **Others:** Explore other MCPs like **Supabase** (for database work), or find ones that suit your workflow on **[Smithery](https://smithery.ai/)**, **Glama**, or **Composio**. You can build your own if you don't find the one you want. 

I recommend using Smithery because it's the easiest way to setup external MCPs to your IDE. Cursor, Windsurf, Trae have started offering toggle MCP servers, explore those first.

For setup instructions, see the **[How to Set Up Taskmaster Guide](./docs/how-to/setup-taskmaster.md)**.

## The Neuralake Demo: A Code-First Data Platform

The `neuralake/` directory contains a working demonstration that brings the "Code-as-Catalog" and "Lightweight Tooling" principles to life.

### Key Architectural Patterns Demonstrated:

*   **Declarative Data Catalog:** See how `neuralake/src/my_tables.py` and `neuralake/src/my_catalog.py` define a complete, queryable data catalog without a single line of configuration or a running server.
*   **Environment-Aware Configuration:** The `neuralake/src/config.py` module manages environment-specific settings (e.g., S3 endpoints, credentials) using the `NEURALAKE_ENV` environment variable (`local` or `production`).
*   **High-Performance ELT:** The `neuralake/src/query_data.py` script executes an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) job, performing joins and transformations on raw data sources *on the fly*.
*   **Federated Querying:** The demo seamlessly joins data from a static Parquet file with a table generated dynamically from a Python function, showcasing the power of a unified query engine.
*   **Comprehensive Verification:** The `neuralake/scripts/production_verification.py` script provides a suite of tests to ensure the platform functions correctly in both local and production-simulated environments.
*   **Modern, Rust-Powered Stack:** The entire pipeline runs without a JVM or a heavy distributed cluster, highlighting the speed and efficiency of Polars and DataFusion for local development and production services.

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to get the **working components** running. Note that Docker is **required** for the S3 simulation (MinIO).

### 1. Prerequisites: Poetry, UV & Docker Desktop

This project uses a modern Python toolchain and requires Docker for local S3 simulation.

**Required:**
- **Docker Desktop**: Must be running for MinIO (S3 simulation)
- **Poetry**: Dependency and packaging manager
- **UV**: Fast package installer (used by Poetry)

If you don't have them, install with `pipx` (recommended):
```bash
# Install pipx if you don't have it
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath

# Install the tools
pipx install poetry
pipx install uv

# Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running
# Download from: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
```

### 2. Configure Poetry to use UV

Tell Poetry to use the UV installer (one-time setup):
```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.installer uv
```

### 3. Start MinIO (Required for S3 Simulation)

**IMPORTANT**: Start Docker Desktop first, then:
```bash
# Clone and navigate to repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>

# Start MinIO S3 server and create bucket
cd neuralake
bash setup_minio.sh
```

### 4. Install Dependencies & Test

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
poetry install

# Generate sample data
poetry run python scripts/create_sample_data.py

# Upload data to MinIO
poetry run python scripts/upload_sample_data_to_minio.py

# Test the query system (requires MinIO running)
poetry run python src/query_data.py

# Run comprehensive verification tests
poetry run python scripts/production_verification.py
```

### Expected Output

If everything is working, `poetry run python src/query_data.py` will show:

```
--- Querying 'part' table from S3 (Local Environment) ---
--- S3 Endpoint: http://localhost:9000 ---

Query successful! Fetched data from S3:

```

### Troubleshooting

**S3 Connection Errors**: Ensure Docker Desktop is running and MinIO was started successfully:
```bash
# Check if Docker is running
docker ps

# Check if MinIO container is running
docker ps | grep minio

# Restart MinIO if needed
bash setup_minio.sh
```

**"Cannot connect to Docker daemon"**: Start Docker Desktop application first.

## Code Quality

This project uses `ruff` for code linting and formatting. The configuration can be found in `neuralake/ruff.toml`.

To check for issues and apply automatic fixes, run the following command from the `neuralake` directory:
```bash
poetry run ruff check --fix .
```

To simply check for issues without applying fixes, run:
```bash
poetry run ruff check .
```

## üöÄ What's Next: Current Development Priorities

### **Immediate Priority: Complete Task 6 - Rust "Surgical Strike" Writer**

**Status**: üöß Foundation Complete, **Core Implementation Gap**

**‚úÖ FOUNDATION COMPLETE**:
- **Dependencies Resolved**: All Cargo.toml dependencies compatible and locked (deltalake 0.26.2, AWS SDK, tokio 1.45.1)
- **Project Structure**: Complete `rust-writer/` directory with proper organization
- **TDD Framework**: Comprehensive test suite ready (`tests/surgical_strike.rs` with all test cases)
- **Configuration System**: Complete config structures for all three processes

**‚ùå IMPLEMENTATION GAP - What We Need**:
1. **Real Writer Process** - Replace placeholder `Writer` struct with actual:
   - DynamoDB locking integration for concurrent safety
   - Delta Lake write operations via MinIO
   - 250ms latency SLA monitoring and retry logic
   
2. **Real Compaction Process** - Replace placeholder `Compactor` with:
   - Delta Lake OPTIMIZE operations to merge small files
   - Intelligent scheduling (time-based, size-based triggers)
   - File size distribution monitoring
   
3. **Real Vacuum Process** - Replace placeholder `Vacuum` with:
   - Retention policy enforcement
   - Unreferenced file cleanup
   - Safe deletion with dependency checks

**Current Blocker**: Task 6.1 says "Set up Rust project" but that's done. We need **actual Rust implementation** of the three-process architecture.

**Next Immediate Steps**:
1. **Update Task 6** to reflect foundation complete, add implementation subtasks
2. **Start with Writer Process** - Most critical for the pipeline
3. **Enable TDD Tests** - Remove `#[ignore]` as real code replaces placeholders
4. **Integration Testing** - Connect to existing MinIO Delta Lake tables

### **Subsequent Priorities (Tasks 7+)**:
- **Task 7**: Testing Framework Integration
- **Task 8**: Kafka Streaming Integration  
- **Task 9**: ROAPI Auto-Generated APIs
- **Task 10**: Performance Benchmarking (Rust vs Spark)

**üîß To Contribute**: The most impactful work right now is completing the Rust writer implementation in `neuralake/rust-writer/`. All tests and infrastructure are ready for TDD development.
