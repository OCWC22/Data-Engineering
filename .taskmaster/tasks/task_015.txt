# Task ID: 15
# Title: Enhanced Code-as-Catalog Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend the catalog system with support for complex data sources (CSV files, JDBC connections), materialized views stored as Delta tables, and integrated data quality checks.
# Details:
1. Add support for CSV files as catalog data sources
2. Implement JDBC connection support for external databases
3. Create materialized view definitions stored as Delta tables
4. Integrate data quality checks within the catalog framework
5. Add data lineage tracking for complex transformations
6. Implement catalog versioning and change management
7. Add advanced metadata management capabilities
8. Extend static site generation for new features

# Test Strategy:
1. Test CSV file integration and metadata extraction
2. Test JDBC connection and data access
3. Test materialized view creation and management
4. Test data quality check integration
5. Test lineage tracking for complex scenarios
6. Test catalog versioning and change management
7. Test extended static site generation
8. Integration testing with existing catalog features
