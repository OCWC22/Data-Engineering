# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Auto-Generated SQL API via ROAPI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Following the Neuralink model, implement ROAPI (Read-Only API) using Apache DataFusion as the query engine. Auto-generate HTTP APIs that accept SQL queries from the Code as a Catalog table definitions.
# Details:
1. Set up ROAPI with Apache DataFusion as the query engine
2. Configure ROAPI to read from Delta Lake tables on MinIO
3. Implement automatic API endpoint generation from catalog definitions
4. Support SQL query execution via HTTP endpoints
5. Add query optimization and caching capabilities
6. Implement authentication and rate limiting
7. Add comprehensive API documentation generation
8. Ensure zero-maintenance API updates when tables change

# Test Strategy:
1. Test ROAPI setup and DataFusion integration
2. Verify automatic endpoint generation from catalog
3. Test SQL query execution via HTTP APIs
4. Performance testing with complex queries
5. Test authentication and security features
6. Test API documentation generation
7. Test automatic updates when catalog changes
8. Load testing with concurrent API requests
