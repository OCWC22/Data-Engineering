# Task ID: 11
# Title: Create Performance Benchmarking Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a suite of benchmark tests to measure Polars/DataFusion query performance against scaled datasets on MinIO, comparing against Spark performance for dual-engine validation.
# Details:
1. Design benchmark suite with standard query patterns (scan, filter, join, aggregate)
2. Implement benchmarks using both Polars/DataFusion ('surgical strike') and Spark ('workhorse')
3. Create scalable test datasets of varying sizes
4. Measure and compare query performance across engines
5. Generate performance reports and visualizations
6. Add automated benchmark execution to CI/CD pipeline
7. Document performance characteristics and recommendations
8. Establish performance regression detection

# Test Strategy:
1. Validate benchmark accuracy and repeatability
2. Test against datasets of various sizes
3. Verify performance measurement accuracy
4. Test both single-node and distributed scenarios
5. Validate performance report generation
6. Test CI/CD integration for automated benchmarking
7. Test regression detection capabilities
8. Compare results against industry benchmarks
