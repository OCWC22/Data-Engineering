# Task ID: 14
# Title: Real-time Ingestion Pipeline Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 10, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Build a complete pipeline that connects Kafka → Low-Latency Writer → Delta Tables → ROAPI, demonstrating the full real-time data flow with both hot path (real-time queries) and cold path (Spark ELT) capabilities.
# Details:
1. Integrate all pipeline components into a cohesive system
2. Implement end-to-end data flow from Kafka to ROAPI
3. Configure hot path for real-time queries via ROAPI
4. Configure cold path for batch ELT via Spark
5. Add pipeline monitoring and observability
6. Implement data lineage tracking
7. Add automated testing for the complete pipeline
8. Document the integrated architecture and operations

# Test Strategy:
1. End-to-end pipeline testing with real data
2. Test hot path latency and performance
3. Test cold path throughput and accuracy
4. Test pipeline resilience and error recovery
5. Test monitoring and alerting systems
6. Test data lineage tracking
7. Load testing with high-volume data streams
8. Disaster recovery and failover testing
