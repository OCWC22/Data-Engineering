# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Enhanced Testing Framework with Polars
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive testing framework using Polars as the standard DataFrame library, including unit tests, integration tests, and production verification scenarios.
# Details:
1. Set up pytest as the primary testing framework with proper configuration
2. Establish **Polars DataFrames** as the standard for all non-Spark data manipulation
3. Create comprehensive unit tests for all neuralake modules using Polars for DataFrame operations
4. Implement integration tests that cover the full data pipeline
5. Add test fixtures and mock data generators for consistent testing
6. Set up coverage reporting with pytest-cov
7. Create production verification scenarios that can run in both local and production environments
8. Implement performance and load testing capabilities with Polars benchmarks
9. Add automated test execution to the CI/CD pipeline
10. Include comparison testing between 'surgical strike' (Rust/Polars) and 'workhorse' (Spark) engines

# Test Strategy:
1. Test framework setup and configuration validation
2. Unit test coverage verification (target: >90%)
3. Integration test execution against real MinIO instance
4. Performance test baseline establishment with Polars benchmarks
5. CI/CD integration testing
6. Production verification scenario validation
7. Load testing with various data sizes and query patterns
8. Error injection and recovery testing
9. Comparative testing between Polars and Spark implementations
