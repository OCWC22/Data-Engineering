# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Low-Latency 'Surgical Strike' Writer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Following the Neuralink three-process architecture, implement the core real-time ingestion mechanism with separate Writer, Compaction, and Vacuum processes using Rust for maximum performance.
# Details:
1. Implement the Neuralink three-process architecture in Rust:
   - **Writer Process:** Continuously appends small files to Delta tables with minimal latency
   - **Compaction Process:** Scheduled process that merges small files into larger, read-optimized files
   - **Vacuum Process:** Cleans up stale, unreferenced files beyond retention period
2. Use AWS DynamoDB as the locking provider for delta-rs to enable safe concurrent operations
3. Integrate with MinIO-based Delta Lake storage
4. Implement inter-process communication and coordination
5. Create intelligent compaction strategies (time-based, size-based)
6. Add configuration options for tuning each process
7. This is the primary mechanism for populating the lakehouse with low-latency requirements

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for each service component
2. Integration tests for the complete write-compact-vacuum cycle
3. Performance tests measuring write latency under various loads
4. Stress tests with high-frequency small writes
5. Test recovery scenarios after service failures
6. Measure and validate file size distributions after compaction
7. Test vacuum retention policies
8. Test MinIO integration for all three processes
9. Test DynamoDB locking mechanism
10. Verify the solution addresses the 'small file problem'
