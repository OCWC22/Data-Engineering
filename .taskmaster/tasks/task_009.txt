# Task ID: 9
# Title: Set Up Apache Kafka for Real-time Ingestion
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure Kafka infrastructure using Docker, configure topics and partitions, implement Kafka clients that integrate with the low-latency writer system for continuous data flow into Delta tables.
# Details:
1. Set up Kafka infrastructure using Docker containers
2. Configure topics and partitions for neural data streams
3. Implement Kafka producers for data ingestion
4. Create Kafka consumers that integrate with the low-latency writer
5. Configure serialization/deserialization for efficient data transfer
6. Implement error handling and retry mechanisms
7. Add monitoring and alerting for Kafka cluster health
8. Document Kafka setup and configuration procedures

# Test Strategy:
1. Test Kafka container startup and configuration
2. Verify topic creation and partition allocation
3. Test producer throughput and latency
4. Test consumer integration with writer system
5. Test error handling and recovery scenarios
6. Performance testing with high-volume data streams
7. Test monitoring and alerting functionality
8. End-to-end testing of Kafka → Writer → Delta pipeline
