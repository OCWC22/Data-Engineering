# Task ID: 8
# Title: Enhance Sample Data Generation with Polars
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refactor scripts/create_sample_data.py to support generating larger, more complex datasets using Polars for data generation and manipulation.
# Details:
1. Design a flexible schema definition format (JSON/YAML)
2. Use **Polars** for all data generation and manipulation operations
3. Implement data generators for common data types using Faker and NumPy
4. Support statistical distributions via NumPy's distribution functions
5. Add correlation capabilities between fields
6. Implement parallel generation for performance
7. Support direct parallel writing to MinIO in Parquet format
8. Configure the utility to create many small files rather than few large ones
9. Add progress reporting and resumability for large generations

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for each data generator type
2. Validation tests to ensure generated data matches specified distributions
3. Performance tests measuring generation speed with Polars
4. Memory usage monitoring during large dataset generation
5. End-to-end test generating a small dataset and validating schema compliance
6. Test parallel generation with different thread counts
7. Test parallel writes to MinIO with various file size configurations
8. Benchmark Polars performance vs other DataFrame libraries
