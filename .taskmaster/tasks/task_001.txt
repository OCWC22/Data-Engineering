# Task ID: 1
# Title: Configure AWS S3 Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up a local, S3-compatible development environment using MinIO running in Docker, and configure the platform to use it for storage.
# Details:
1. Create a Docker Compose file for MinIO service
2. Configure MinIO with default credentials and expose ports 9000 (API) and 9001 (Console)
3. Create scripts/instructions for starting the service and initializing a 'neuralake-bucket'
4. Update the `neuralake` library configuration to accept custom S3 endpoint URLs
5. Implement storage abstraction layer that can work with both local and S3-compatible backends
6. Add proper error handling for network and permission issues

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify MinIO Docker container starts correctly and is accessible
2. Test bucket creation using AWS CLI configured for MinIO endpoint
3. Unit tests for S3 backend operations with MinIO
4. Test writing and reading a small Parquet file to 'neuralake-bucket' using delta-rs or pyarrow
5. Test error handling for connection issues and permissions
6. Verify the same code works with both MinIO and actual AWS S3 by just changing the endpoint URL
