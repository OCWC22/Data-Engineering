# Task ID: 12
# Title: Set Up Containerized Apache Spark Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure a containerized Apache Spark environment that can connect to the same Delta Lake on MinIO, providing the 'workhorse' complement to the 'surgical strike' Rust stack for large-scale ELT operations.
# Details:
1. Set up containerized Spark cluster using Docker
2. Configure Spark to connect to Delta Lake on MinIO
3. Install and configure delta-spark libraries
4. Set up Spark UI and monitoring
5. Configure resource allocation and tuning
6. Implement Spark job submission workflows
7. Add logging and error handling
8. Document Spark setup and usage procedures

# Test Strategy:
1. Test Spark cluster startup and configuration
2. Verify Delta Lake connectivity and operations
3. Test read/write operations with MinIO
4. Performance testing with large datasets
5. Test resource allocation and scaling
6. Test job submission and monitoring
7. Test error handling and recovery
8. Integration testing with existing pipeline
